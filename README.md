# Split
A program intended to make it easier to keep track of money owed from shared purchases

# How it works

Two people live together. Instead of relying on memory, they log their shared expenses in Split. At any moment, they can see how much they've each spent. If one has spent less for shared expenses, he can take care the next few purchases to make it fair for the other.

# What's missing
- Need to set up a database to make persistent saves possible
